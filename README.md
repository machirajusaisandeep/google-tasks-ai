Create a TasksBoard application with the following features and requirements:

- Use React and Material-UI for the frontend.
- Implement dark mode support with a toggle button.
- Use IndexedDB for storage of tasks and lists.
- Allow creation of up to 4 lists.
- Enable adding, completing, and deleting tasks within each list.
- Implement list renaming functionality.
- Add a search bar to filter tasks across all lists.
- Highlight tasks that match the search text.
- Center-align the search bar in the app bar.
- Implement keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K on Mac, Ctrl+K on Windows) to focus the search bar.
- Allow deleting entire lists.
- Ensure no two lists have the same name.
- Remove unnecessary icons (refresh, menu, view week).
- Start with no initial lists; users should be able to add lists as needed.
- Use Framer Motion for animations when adding new lists or tasks.
- Display a count of completed tasks for each list.
- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.

The application should have a clean, modern UI with a focus on usability and performance. All data manipulations should be reflected in both the UI and the IndexedDB storage in real-time.
